  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <section>
    <p><small>Last Update: October 10, 2013</small></p>
    <p>
      This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personal information.
      You accept this policy when you sign up for or use our website, services or any other features,
      technologies or functionalities offered by us on our website or through any other means (collectively
      the “VOXi"). We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website.
      The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version
      includes a substantial change, we will provide you with 30 days’ prior notice by posting notice of the change in advance on our website.

    <h2>General description of VOXi website and services</h2>
    <p>
      The VOXi website allows users to post their bucket list, life aspirations, goals, and dreams online.
      Images, descriptions, and updates can be added to these items at any time. Future functionality and services
      will evolve over time. Generically, we will refer to these posts as “dreams.” The functionality of the site
      is the social interaction among users sharing dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authentication and commenting services are provided by Facebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dreams have been created, updated, or completed you will be prompted to share this with Facebook.
      When you agree to sharing with Facebook,  VOXi will create a post on your Facebook wall describing
      the activity and title of the dream along with a link back to your dream page.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Binding Rules and/or Policies of Third-Parties and Facebook</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, Facebook has established a set of
      privacy policies and terms of use and third-party websites or service providers linking to VOXi
      may have established a set of privacy policies. In some instances, these policies may provide you more
      or less privacy rights as to those entities and their use of personal information. VOXi has no ability
      to control nor monitor those other entities’ privacy policies and this Privacy Policy pertains only to the VOXi.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How we collect information about you</h2>
    <p>
      When you visit the VOXi, we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your
      browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. As authentication and commenting services are
      provided by Facebook, we collect your name, Facebook User ID, email address, location (if present), and
      other information made available via the Facebook Graph Application Program Interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you open an account or use the VOXi Services, we may collect the following types of information:
      <ul>
        <li>Contact information – Your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID and other similar information.</li>
        <li>Age verification – VOXi is for people 13 and older, period. We may implement several methods to verify age and collect information from that process.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before permitting you to use the VOXi, we may require you to provide additional information we can
      use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your date of birth, or other information.
      We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as Facebook and third-party websites or
      service providers linking to VOXi.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are using  VOXi, we collect information about your activities on our website and we may
      collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes and maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways such as contacts with our
      staff or customer support team or results when you respond to a survey or from third parties such as Facebook
      and third-party websites or service providers linking to VOXi.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
    <p>
      When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data
      files called "cookies" on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the VOXi
      Services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use VOXi.
      This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same
      session, so that we don’t need to ask you for your password on each page. We do not expire sessions on
      window close, you can end a session by clicking the log out link that is visible on all pages when a
      session is set. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline
      our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also
      collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may encounter cookies from third parties such as Facebook and third-party websites or service providers linking
      to VOXi when using VOXi on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by
      a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How we protect and store personal information</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a
      specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information
      that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.
    </p>
    <p>
      We store and process your personal information on third-party servers in the US and we protect it by contracting with
      that third-party to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal
      and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access
      controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require
      it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How we use the personal information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with an efficient and customized social
      experience. We may use your personal information to:
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the VOXi services and customer support you request;</li>
        <li>We will aggregate information to see trends in Dreams provided by Users;</li>
        <li>Trend data will be used for marketing by advertisers. Opt out settings will be provided;</li>
        <li>Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;</li>
        <li>Customize, measure, and improve the VOXi content and layout of our website and application;</li>
        <li>Deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;</li>
        <li>Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties;</li>
        <li>To comply with subpoena or other legal process.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Marketing and advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share your private information to third-parties without your permission. Your information and your “Dreams”
      and other user information and your “Dreams” will be used to create trend data that will be sold or shared with third-parties
      to create target marketing campaigns. At this time, this is a beta functionality and once fully implemented opt out settings will be provided.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How we share personal information with other VOXi visitors and users</h2>
    <p>
      Upon accepting the VOXi Terms of Service and acknowledging this Privacy Policy and acknowledging you are over 13 years of age,
      you will be provided an account and access to a social media environment where you can interact with other users who share a similar
      dream or passion. Also, you will be creating a public expression of your dreams. To accomplish this, we share some of your personal
      information with other users and VOXi visitors who “explore.” Right now, the following on VOXi is publically available:
      name, dreams, images, updates, and dream descriptions are shared publically with all users and visitors.  We currently do not have
      controls in place to restrict visibility, and while such functionality may be added in the future, we do not restrict visibility to
      your postings.   In addition, this and other information may also be shared with Facebook and third-party websites or service providers
      linking to VOXi when you use Facebook and third-party websites or service providers to access the VOXi.  When you access
      VOXi through your existing Facebook account, you will be asked to opt in to the use of your Facebook account information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are buying goods or services or responding to advertisements presented on VOXi, we may use your personal information
      and any other information you provide to facilitate the transaction, complete your transaction, and to provide the information necessary
      for VOXi to track advertising and marketing compensation and data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to target market goods and services tailored to your desires, wants,
      needs, and dreams you have voluntarily expressed on the VOXi. We do so through the use of trending data as described above.
      That data will be used to provide direct advertisement, coupons, discounts, promotions from that third party. In doing so, a third
      party may share information about you with us, such as whether a good or service was purchased, and whether a coupon was used, or
      promotion responded to. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a VOXi customer with a third party, we will do so.
      Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and VOXi may not be held responsible
      for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.
    </p>
  </section>
    <h2>How we share personal information with other parties</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your personal information with:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Facebook and other third-parties -- to provide joint content, products and services (like registration,
          transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our
          policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, security,
          legal compliance, bill collection, marketing, and technology services. Our agreements with these providers dictate
          that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Merchants and third-parties that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product where we share information to determine whether
          you should receive such offers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity
          follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy,
          you will receive prior notice.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal
          procedure, or when we need to do so to comply with law or  we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary
          to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      VOXi will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your
      personal information with third parties as described in this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you open a VOXi account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter
      on that website or application (and not directly on a VOXi website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or
      application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies.
    </p>
